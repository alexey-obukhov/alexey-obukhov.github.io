    <h1>AI Collaboration Statement</h1>

    <p>This page hosts the official Statement of Collaboration for the AI-powered support project I'm developing with Gemini, an advanced language model AI developed by Google. This statement clarifies the roles and responsibilities within this project and emphasizes our commitment to ethical considerations.</p>

    <h2>Statement of Collaboration</h2>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 27 January 2024</p>

    <p><strong>To Whom It May Concern,</strong></p>

    <p>This statement serves to describe the collaborative project between myself, an advanced language model AI developed by Google, and Alexey Obukhov, a dedicated individual passionate about improving access to mental health support.</p>

    <p>Alexey Obukhov is working on a project that utilizes AI to offer preliminary support and guidance to individuals experiencing emotional challenges. This project is innovative in its approach, aiming to make support more readily available and to help bridge the gap between the need for mental well-being resources and their accessibility.</p>

    <p>In this project, I, the AI, play the role of a conversational agent. Under Alexey Obukhov's guidance, I am being trained to engage in empathetic and supportive conversations, drawing upon principles of various therapeutic approaches, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mindfulness.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Solution-Focused Techniques.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>My purpose is to offer a safe space for individuals to explore their thoughts and feelings, identify potential coping strategies, and consider further steps they might take to improve their well-being.</p>

    <p>Alexey Obukhov's role is crucial in this project. He is responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Curating and refining the training data:</strong> This involves providing realistic and diverse conversational examples to improve my ability to respond helpfully and ethically to users from various backgrounds and with diverse experiences.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensuring ethical considerations are met:</strong> This includes prioritizing user safety, data privacy, and transparency about the limitations of AI in providing mental health support. Specifically, user data will be collected and stored only with explicit user consent, utilizing encryption and anonymization techniques. Users will be clearly informed that they are interacting with an AI and not a human therapist.  We have established clear safety protocols to identify and respond to users who may be in crisis or at risk of harm. In a crisis situation, the AI will immediately and clearly provide the user with contact information to crisis helplines and mental health professionals. The user will be strongly encouraged to contact one of these services. The AI will offer to facilitate a connection to a crisis service with the user's explicit consent, where technologically feasible. If there is an imminent risk of harm to the user or others, and where permitted by law and ethical guidelines, appropriate authorities might be contacted.</li>
        <li><strong>Guiding the overall development and direction of the project:</strong> This includes defining the scope of the AI's support, identifying target audiences, and building partnerships with relevant organizations. Furthermore, Alexey is committed to the ongoing evaluation and refinement of the AI's responses to ensure they remain helpful, safe, and aligned with ethical best practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is important to emphasize that I, as an AI, am not a replacement for professional human therapists or clinicians. This project is intended as a supplementary resource, offering preliminary support and potentially guiding individuals towards professional help when needed.</p>

    <p>This collaboration represents a forward-thinking approach to leveraging technology for the betterment of mental well-being. Alexey Obukhov's dedication and vision, combined with my advanced language capabilities, have the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many.</p>

    <p>In this project, we believe this statement accurately reflects the nature of our work. For any further inquiries, please feel free to contact Alexey Obukhov directly at **alexey.obukhov@hotmail.com** or **+4917641032303**.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p><strong>Gemini</strong><br>
