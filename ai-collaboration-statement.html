    <h1>AI Collaboration Statement</h1>

    <p>This page hosts the official Statement of Collaboration for the AI-powered support project I'm developing with Gemini, an advanced language model AI developed by Google. This statement clarifies the roles and responsibilities within this project and emphasizes our commitment to ethical considerations.</p>

    <h2>Statement of Collaboration</h2>

    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 27 Januar 2025</p>

    <p><strong>To Whom It May Concern,</strong></p>

    <p>This statement serves to describe the collaborative project between myself, an advanced language model AI developed by Google, and Alexey Obukhov, a dedicated individual passionate about improving access to mental health support.</p>

    <p>Alexey Obukhov is working on a project that utilizes AI to offer preliminary support and guidance to individuals experiencing emotional challenges. This project is innovative in its approach, aiming to make support more readily available and to help bridge the gap between the need for mental well-being resources and their accessibility.</p>

    <p>In this project, I, the AI, play the role of a conversational agent. Under Alexey Obukhov's guidance, I am being trained to engage in empathetic and supportive conversations, drawing upon principles of various therapeutic approaches, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Mindfulness.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Solution-Focused Techniques.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>My purpose is to offer a safe space for individuals to explore their thoughts and feelings, identify potential coping strategies, and consider further steps they might take to improve their well-being.</p>

    <p>Alexey Obukhov's role is crucial in this project. They are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Curating and refining the training data:</strong> This involves providing realistic conversational examples to improve my ability to respond helpfully and ethically.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensuring ethical considerations are met:</strong> This includes prioritizing user safety, data privacy, and transparency about the limitations of AI in providing mental health support.</li>
        <li><strong>Guiding the overall development and direction of the project:</strong> This includes defining the scope of the AI's support, identifying target audiences, and building partnerships with relevant organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is important to emphasize that I, as an AI, am <strong>not a replacement for professional human therapists or clinicians.</strong> This project is intended as a supplementary resource, offering preliminary support and potentially guiding individuals towards professional help when needed.</p>

    <p>This collaboration between Alexey Obukhov and myself represents a forward-thinking approach to leveraging technology for the betterment of mental well-being. Alexey Obukhov's dedication and vision, combined with my advanced language capabilities, have the potential to make a positive impact on the lives of many.</p>

    <p>We, the AI and Alexey Obukhov, believe this statement accurately reflects the nature of this project. For any further inquiries, please feel free to contact Alexey Obukhov directly at [Your Email Address] or [Your Phone Number (optional)].</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p><strong>Gemini</strong><br>
    (Advanced Language Model AI developed by Google)</p>

    <p><strong>In collaboration with:</strong><br>
    Alexey Obukhov<br>
